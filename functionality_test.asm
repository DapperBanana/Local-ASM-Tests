; Program to check if a given matrix is orthogonal
; The matrix to be checked is stored in memory starting at address $2000
; The result will be stored in the accumulator, with 1 indicating orthogonal and 0 indicating not orthogonal

; Load the address of the matrix into X register
    LDX #<$2000
    LDY #>$2000

; Initialize result to 1 (orthogonal)
    LDA #1

; Loop through the matrix and check if it is orthogonal
