; Calculate the volume of a cone given its radius and height

; Assume radius is stored in memory location $00 and height is stored in memory location $01

LDX #$00        ; Load the radius from memory location $00
LDY #$01        ; Load the height from memory location $01

; Calculate the volume of the cone: V = (1/3)*pi*(r^2)*h
; Where pi is approximately 3.14159

LDAA $00        ; Load the radius into accumulator A
STAA $02        ; Store the radius for later use

LDD $00         ; Load the radius into D register for squaring
MUL $00         ; Square the radius
STD $04         ; Store the result in memory location $04

LDD $04         ; Load the squared radius into accumulator D
DIV #$0A        ; Divide by 10 to approximate pi
DIV #$01        ; Divide by 1 to get rid of any remainders
STD $06         ; Store the result in memory location $06

LDAA $01        ; Load the height into accumulator A
MUL $06         ; Multiply by pi*(r^2)
DIV #$12        ; Divide by 18 to get 1/3 of the volume
STD $08         ; Store the final volume in memory location $08

; The volume of the cone is now stored in memory location $08

LOOP: BRA LOOP    ; Infinite loop to keep the program running
