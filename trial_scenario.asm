; Program to calculate the area of a regular tetrahedron
; The formula to calculate the area of a regular tetrahedron is:
; Area = sqrt(3) * side^2

            ORG $1000

Side        EQU $00  ; Define memory location for side length
Area        EQU $01  ; Define memory location for area

            LDA #3    ; Load the constant 3 for sqrt(3) calculation
            STA $02    ; Store it in memory location $02

            LDA #4    ; Load the side length of the tetrahedron (e.g. 4)
            STA Side   ; Store it in memory location Side

            CLC       ; Clear the carry for multiplication
            LDA Side   ; Load the side length into the accumulator
            ADC Side   ; Add the side length to itself (side length ^ 2)
            STA $03    ; Store the result in memory location $03

            LDA $03    ; Load the square of the side length
            STA $04    ; Store it in memory location $04

            LDA $02    ; Load the constant sqrt(3)
            STA $05    ; Store it in memory location $05

            CLC       ; Clear the carry for multiplication
            LDA $04    ; Load the square of the side length
            ADC #$00   ; Add zero to clear the carry
            ADC $04    ; Add the square of the side length again
            ADC $04    ; Add the square of the side length one more time
            STA Area   ; Store the final result in memory location Area

            BRK       ; End of program
