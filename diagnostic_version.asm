; assuming the image data is stored in memory starting at $2000

    sta $00     ; store accumulator in Zero Page memory location $00

    tax             ; store it in the X register for later use
    lda #$02        ; load the accumulator with the grayscale conversion coefficients (0.299, 0.587, 0.114) scaled by 256
    mul $00         ; multiply it with the pixel value
