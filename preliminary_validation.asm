START:
    LDX #20       ; Number of faces on an icosahedron
    LDY #5        ; Number of sides on a face of an icosahedron
    LDZ #3        ; Number of vertices on a side of an icosahedron

; Subroutine to calculate the area of an icosahedron
CALCULATE_AREA:
    LDA X          ; Load number of faces
    CLC
    ADC X          ; Multiply by the number of sides
    STA TEMP       ; Temporarily store the result

LOOP_FACES:

    CLC
    ADC TEMP       ; Multiply by the number of vertices
    STA TEMP       ; Store the updated result

    DEX            ; Decrement the number of faces
    BNE LOOP_FACES ; Loop until all faces are processed

    RTS            ; Return from subroutine

; Data section
X:   .byte 20       ; Number of faces on an icosahedron
Y:   .byte 5        ; Number of sides on a face of an icosahedron
Z:   .byte 3        ; Number of vertices on a side of an icosahedron
