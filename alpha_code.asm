; Program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius
; Input: Radius in memory location "radius"
; Output: Area in memory location "area"

        .org $2000
radius  .byte $05    ; Radius of the circle
area    .word $0000  ; Area of the circle

        ; Load the radius into the accumulator
        lda radius

        ; Calculate the area using the formula: area = PI * radius^2
        ; PI is assumed to be 3.14159 for simplicity

        ldx $00    ; Load the radius into X register
        ldy $00    ; Load the radius into Y register
