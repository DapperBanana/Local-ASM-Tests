; Assume user behavior data is stored in an array in memory, where each entry represents a user action
; Each entry could contain information such as page views, clicks, time spent on page, etc.

; Initialize variables
LDA #0          ; Initialize total page views
STA total_views

LDA #0          ; Initialize total clicks
STA total_clicks

LDA #0          ; Initialize total time spent on page
STA total_time

LDA #0          ; Initialize counter for looping through user data
STA index

; Loop through user behavior data array
loop:
LDA user_data, X  ; Load user behavior data at current index
CMP #END_MARKER   ; Check if end of data marker reached
BEQ end_loop      ; Exit loop if end of data marker found

; Extract relevant information from user data
; For example, increment total page views, clicks, and total time based on user action

; Update total page views
LDA user_data, X+1  ; Load page views from user data
CLC
ADC total_views     ; Add page views to total_views
STA total_views     ; Store updated total_views

; Update total clicks
LDA user_data, X+2  ; Load clicks from user data
CLC
ADC total_clicks    ; Add clicks to total_clicks
STA total_clicks    ; Store updated total_clicks

; Update total time spent on page
LDA user_data, X+3  ; Load time spent on page from user data
CLC
ADC total_time      ; Add time spent on page to total_time
STA total_time      ; Store updated total_time

; Increment counter and continue looping
INC index
JMP loop

end_loop:
; Display or process the aggregated user behavior data
; For example, print the total page views, clicks, and time spent on page
