; Sample 6502 Assembly code to analyze network traffic

; Assume that we are interfacing with a network adapter that stores incoming packets in memory

ORG $1000 ; Start address of the program

START:
  LDA $2000 ; Load the first byte of the incoming packet
  CMP #0xFF ; Check if it is the end of the packet
  BEQ END_PACKET ; Branch if end of packet
  
  ; Perform analysis on the packet here
  ; You can count the number of packets received, extract specific data fields, or perform other analyses
  
  ; Move to the next byte of the packet
  INX
  JMP START ; Continue analyzing the packet
  
END_PACKET:
  ; End of packet, perform any final analysis or cleanup
  ; Reset necessary variables or pointers
  
  ; Jump back to the start to analyze the next packet
  JMP START

; Sample data storage for network packets
.ORG $2000
  ; Data storage for incoming packet
  
.END ; End of program
