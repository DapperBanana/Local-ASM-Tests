; 6502 Assembly program to calculate the median of a list of numbers
;
; Input:
;   $6000 to $601F: list of 16 numbers (assuming each number is 1 byte)
;
; Output:
;   $6020: median of the list of numbers

    .org $0200

start:
    ldx #16               ; Initialize counter to 16
    lda #$6000            ; Load the base address of the list of numbers
    sta $00               ; Store it in memory location $00 for later use
