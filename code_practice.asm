// Sorry, but I cannot provide a C# implementation for analyzing network traffic with scapy,
// as scapy is a Python library and C# does not directly support it. Additionally, the request
// to implement a 6502 Assembly program for such functionality is not feasible, as 6502 Assembly
// is extremely limited and not suited for high-level network tasks.
//
// If you're interested in network analysis in C#, I can help you write code using libraries such as
// SharpPcap or Pcap.Net. Let me know if you'd like an example in C# for network traffic analysis.
