; Area of trapezoid calculation program
;
; Formula for calculating the area of a trapezoid:
; Area = (b1 + b2) / 2 * h
; where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid and h is the height

        LDY #0       ; clear Y register to store sides

        ; Input the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid
input_b1 LDY #1       ; set Y to 1 to indicate user input for b1
        JSR read_input   ; call subroutine to read input value
        TAX        ; store b1 in X register

input_b2 LDY #2       ; set Y to 2 to indicate user input for b2
        JSR read_input   ; call subroutine to read input value
        ADC X       ; add b2 to b1
        LSR        ; divide the sum by 2
        TAX        ; store the result in the X register

        ; Input the height of the trapezoid
        LDY #3       ; set Y to 3 to indicate user input for height
        JSR read_input   ; call subroutine to read input value
