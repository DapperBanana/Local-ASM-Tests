    ; Swap two variables without using a temporary variable

    ; Assume X is the first variable and Y is the second variable

    LDA X     ; Load the value of X into the accumulator
    EOR Y     ; XOR the value of Y with the accumulator (XOR swaps values without a temporary variable)
    STA X     ; Store the result in X
    EOR Y     ; XOR the value of Y with the accumulator (undo the swap)
    STA Y     ; Store the result in Y

    ; Continue with the rest of the program
    ; X and Y now have their values swapped
