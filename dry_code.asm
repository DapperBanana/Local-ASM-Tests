; Load the image data into memory
LDX #img_data ; Load X register with the starting address of the image data
LDY #0 ; Load Y register with the offset within the image data

; Perform edge detection (Sobel algorithm)
; Implement the Sobel algorithm here

; Compare the detected edges with a template for face recognition
; Implement the comparison algorithm here

; If the detected features match the template, recognize the face
; Implement the recognition logic here
