; 6502 Assembly program to generate a random sentence using Markov chains

.word $2000 ; Starting address of the program

.text
    LDA #0      ; Clear accumulator
    STA $00      ; Initialize memory address for storing sentence
    STA $01
    
    LDA #<seed+1 ; Set seed for random number generation
    STA $D010    ; Store low byte of seed in CIA 1 timer A
    LDA #>seed+1
    STA $D011    ; Store high byte of seed in CIA 1 timer A
    
loop:
    JSR getNextWord  ; Get the next word in the sentence
    CMP #0
    BEQ end       ; If end of sentence is reached, exit the loop
    JSR printWord  ; Print the word
    JMP loop      ; Repeat for next word

end:
    BRK           ; End of program

getNextWord:
    ; Use Markov chain to select the next word based on the previous word
    ; Implement logic here to generate the next word and store it in memory
    ; Use random number generator to select the word
    
    ; Pseudo code example:
    ; LDA prevWord
    ; CMP #1
    ; BEQ random1
    ; CMP #2
    ; BEQ random2
    ; ...
    
    RTS

printWord:
    ; Implement logic to print the word stored in memory to the screen
    ; Use ASCII codes to print characters
    
    RTS

seed:
    .byte 0      ; Seed for random number generation

.word $3000 ; Define memory address for storing sentence
