 ; Program to calculate the area of a regular icosahedron
 
 ; Inputs: Length of the edge of the icosahedron (in register A)
 ; Outputs: Area of the icosahedron (in register X)
 ; Constants: Square root of 3 (in memory location $0100)
 
 ldx #0   ; Initialize X register to 0
 lda edge_length  ; Load the edge length into register A
 
 ; Calculate (5 * sqrt(3) * a^2) and store it in register X
 lda #$01   ; Load sqrt(3)
 sta $0100  ; Store sqrt(3) in memory location $0100
 lda $0100  ; Load sqrt(3) back into register A
 asl a   ; Multiply by 2 (sqrt(3) * 2 = 2*sqrt(3))
 sta $0101  ; Store the result in memory location $0101
 lda $0101  ; Load the result back into register A
 asl a   ; Multiply by 2 again (2*sqrt(3) * 2 = 4*sqrt(3))
 sta $0102  ; Store the result in memory location $0102
 lda $0102  ; Load the result back into register A
 asl a   ; Multiply by 2 again (4*sqrt(3) * 2 = 8*sqrt(3))
 sta $0103  ; Store the result in memory location $0103
 lda $0103  ; Load the result back into register A
 asl a   ; Multiply by 2 again (8*sqrt(3) * 2 = 16*sqrt(3))
 sta $0104  ; Store the result in memory location $0104
 lda $0104  ; Load the result back into register A
 asl a   ; Multiply by 2 again (16*sqrt(3) * 2 = 32*sqrt(3))
 sta $0105  ; Store the result in memory location $0105
 lda $0105  ; Load the result back into register A
 asl a   ; Multiply by 2 again (32*sqrt(3) * 2 = 64*sqrt(3))
 sta $0106  ; Store the result in memory location $0106
 lda $0106  ; Load the result back into register A
 asl a   ; Multiply by 2 again (64*sqrt(3) * 2 = 128*sqrt(3))
 sta $0107  ; Store the result in memory location $0107
 lda $0107  ; Load the result back into register A
 asl a   ; Multiply by 2 again (128*sqrt(3) * 2 = 256*sqrt(3))
 sta $0108  ; Store the result in memory location $0108

 clc   ; Clear the carry flag
 tax   ; Store the length squared in register X
 tay   ; Store sqrt(3) in register Y
 mul tax  ; Multiply sqrt(3) by the length squared (256*sqrt(3))
 tax   ; Store the result in register X
 lda #$05  ; Load the coefficient 5
 clc   ; Clear the carry flag
 adc tax  ; Add (5 * sqrt(3) * a^2) to the result
