; Calculate the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height
; Volume = pi * radius^2 * height

; Define constants
PI equ 3.14159
R equ 5 ; radius of the cylinder
H equ 10 ; height of the cylinder

; Start of program
start:
    lda R
    jsr square ; calculate radius^2
    sta radius_squared
    
    lda radius_squared
    lda PI ; load the value of PI
    jsr multiply ; multiply radius^2 by PI
    sta volume_partial
    
    lda volume_partial
    lda H ; load the value of the height
    jsr multiply ; multiple volume_partial by height
    sta volume
    
    ; Output volume
    lda volume
    ; Here you would add code to output the result to the screen or save it in memory
    
    ; End of program
